Good Morning Abhilash,
 
The world can broadly be divided into three camps:
 
1. Those who don’t know what MSG, or monosodium glutamate, is
2. Those who think MSG, a common flavouring agent, is the devil
3. Those who think MSG is the devil but love their Chinese cuisine too much to care
 
I’m not sure what version of the MSG boogeyman you grew up with, but here are some of the symptoms I was warned about by an assortment of well-meaning relatives: hives, hair loss, impotence, diabetes, and spontaneous human combustion. (I made one of those up, but if your relatives are anything like mine, I’m not sure you’ll be able to tell which one that is.)
 
In reality, MSG was never really the problem. Its connection with Chinese food was. At a time when globalisation was ramping up, and countries still hadn’t come to terms with foreign cultures, it was easy to sell the myth that Chinese food may be inherently dangerous. MSG was made the scapegoat for a now-discredited condition called Chinese Restaurant Syndrome.
 
The stigma attached to MSG has mostly subsided, but India’s having a whole new MSG moment. This time, the issue isn’t Chinese food. It’s everything Chinese. Products. Apps. Investment.
 
India has some serious problems on her plate—an unemployment rate of 23.5%, a rapidly spreading pandemic that has infected over 200,000 and killed more than 6,000, a worsening economic slowdown. All caused by factors, both local and global.
 
A growing movement in the country, though, would have you believe the source of India’s woes is China. It has led to a ‘Boycott China’ trend that has yielded some comical results. The sudden popularity of an Indian-made rival to TikTok, which turned out to be more Pakistan-made than anything. Or army stores banning products from Indian businesses such as Cello and Bajaj.
 
Saying “Be vocal for local” is one thing, but practising it is a whole other matter. Will getting rid of everything China-related really help India, though? Or is it another MSG moment—a fleeting but unfounded panic?
